# ARQMath Clef 2020
[ARQMath](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/ARQMath/) lab at [CLEF 2020](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/).  focuses on mathematical information retrieval. There will be two tasks for this lab:
  ### Task 1 
  Given a math question (a question related to some mathematical information need that contains at least one formula), participants will retrieve a list of possible answers to that question, ranked based on relevance.
  
  ### Task 2
  Given a formula as a query, participants should retrieve formulas related to the formula query.
  
 
 While available data for participants are from year 2010 to 2018. The topics for both tasks are selected from posts (questions) created in 2019. Futher information please check the ARQMath [webpage](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/ARQMath/). You may also consider joining the discussion forum [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arqmath-lab).

# Collection
In this lab we will be using data from [Math Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) (MSE)The dateset for this lab is currently available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZPKIWDnhMGRaPNVLi1reQxZWTfH2R4u3?usp=sharing). This data was provided by [Archive](https://archive.org/) and several preprocessing have been done on the initial data. There are 7 files in this dataset:
  #### Users
  Users can post questions and answers and therefor each post is written by a user. Each users has a unique id along with other information such as display name, age, location, the date they created their profile and the reputations points earned based on their activities on MSE such as receiving an "up" vote on an answer given.
  #### Badges
  Besides reputation for each user, they can have a list of badges they received. There are three class of badges 3:bronze, 2:silver and 1:gold. Each badges is linked to a user by user id.
  #### Votes
  Members of MSE, can give different votes to questions and answers. In the vote file, for each vote there is a unique id, related post id, vote type [1 to 13], vote date and the user id of the voter.
  #### Tags  
  Each question on the MSE, can have different tags that are determined by the user posting the question. In tag file, one can find list of all possible tags with their repetition count. However, in the post file, you can get the exact question tags.
 #### Comments
 Users can comment on both questions and answers. In the comment file, each comment has its own unique id, along with the related post id, the id of user who written the comment, its creation date, its text and score.
  #### PostLinks
  Each question on MSE can be associated with other questions; it can be related to another question or it can be its duplicate.
  In the post links file, each link has a unique id, the post id of the question, the post id of related question (relatedpostid), the link type [1:related, 3:duplicate].
#### PostHistory
  It is possible that several edits have been applied on a post. While in the post file, there is only the final version of the post, in this file, one can finds edits on a post. The data provided in this file, shows edit id, type of edit, post id, revision GUI id, creation date, user id and display name, comment, text and close reason id. 
  #### Posts
  This is the main file for the task, where there are both questions and answers. Each post has a unique id, post type [1: question, 2:answer], the creation date, body, score and view count. For each answer, there is parent id which shows the question id for which the answer was provided. Each question has a title, set of tags and answer count.

# Available tools
To facilitate the data loading, the lab organizer provided a python code to read all the data and iterate over it. The code is available on [github](https://github.com/ARQMath/ARQMath). Also with this code, participants can view each thread (question along with answers and other related information) as html file.

<a name="topics"></a>
# Sample Topics
There are 3 sample topics (questions) provided for task 1. To extract the title of question, you can use "h1" tag. The post is located in "postcell" div. The current qrel file is created just as an example. The criteria for selecting the candidate relevant documents for now is based on the duplicate and related post links that exists in the original math stack exchange dataset (from 2010 to 2019) and relevance is determined based on the community scores for each answer. There are 4 different relevance scores as follows:

Relevance degree | Not relevant | Low | Medium | High
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
Score | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3

# Getting Started
The ARQMath google drive, contains 4 directories. All the files have version and only the version that should be used for the task in kept in the directory and the older versions are kept in Old versions directory.

The collection directory contains all the data files that will be used for both task one and two. Each of the two task, has their own directory. 

For task one, there are three sample topic provided for now in Task1 directory. The sample qrel and query files are created for these three topics. Also a sample retrieval file is provided which is in standard trec format and evaluation can be done with trec eval tools.

For task two, the data will be available soon.

Finally formula directory, provides all the formulas in the collection in four different files, three of them showing  different representation of formulas, namely latex string, symbol layout tree and operator tree. (Only one is available for now.) There are 5 columns in these files showing formula id, post id, thread id, type of post they appeared in which can be question, answer, comment or title and finally formula itself which is represented accordingly. The fourth file will be combination of these three files.
